### Setup

This repo provides a React application bootstrap. To get setup, run these commands:
 
- Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

- Run it locally

```sh
npm start
```

The command above will:

- Start an HTTP server for the API (localhost:4000);
- Start an HTTP server (powered by react-scripts) for the front-end (localhost:3000);

### API instructions

This repository provides a basic API (running under port 4000) that returns the required data for the application.
The API will be available after running the `npm start` command.

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
